### How this library differ from `reanimated-bottom-sheet` or `react-native-scroll-bottom-sheet`?

This library was built to provide the most native-like experience and could fit any use-case that developers wants it to be. While both libraries providing similar experience, but they still missing the following:

- `reanimated-bottom-sheet`: Seamless gesture interaction between the sheet and the content.
- `react-native-scroll-bottom-sheet`: Extracting scrollable content to allow developers customize the sheet content, like integrate React Navigation as the sheet content.

Both libraries are great! and I have used both of them at my work ❤️
