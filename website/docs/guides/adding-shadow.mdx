![React Native Bottom Sheet Shadow](/img/bottom-sheet-shadow.jpg)

To add shadow to the bottom sheet, you will need to pass the `style` prop with shadow styling config, I recommend checking out [React Native Shadow Generator](https://ethercreative.github.io/react-native-shadow-generator/) by [@ethercreative](https://github.com/ethercreative).

:::note NOTICE

You may notice that shadow looks different between **iOS** and **Android**, that's because each platform handle drawing shadows differently, read more about [Android Shadows](https://developer.android.com/training/material/shadows-clipping).
