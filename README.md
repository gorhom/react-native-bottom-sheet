```sh
yarn add @gorhom/bottom-sheet@2.0.0-alpha.0
# or
npm install @gorhom/bottom-sheet@2.0.0-alpha.0
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You need to install [react-native-reanimated v2](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/next/installation) & [react-native-gesture-handler](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler) and follow their installation instructions.

## Usage

```tsx
import React, { useCallback, useMemo, useRef } from 'react';
import { View, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import BottomSheet from '@gorhom/bottom-sheet';

const App = () => {
  // hooks
  const bottomSheetRef = useRef<BottomSheet>(null);

  // variables
  const snapPoints = useMemo(() => ['25%', '50%', '90%'], []);

  // callbacks
  const handleSheetChanges = useCallback((index: number) => {
    console.log('handleSheetChanges', index);
  }, []);

  // renders
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <BottomSheet
        ref={bottomSheetRef}
        initialSnapIndex={1}
        snapPoints={snapPoints}
        onChange={handleSheetChanges}
      >
        {/* INSERT A SCROLLABLE HERE */}
      </BottomSheet>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 24,
  },
});

export default App;

## FAQ

>   - Seamless gesture interaction between the sheet and the content.
> - `react-native-scroll-bottom-sheet`
>   - Extracting scrollable content to allow developers customize the sheet content, like integrate `React Navigation` as the sheet content.
>
> Both libraries are great! and I have used both of them at my work ‚ù§Ô∏è

#### How can I integrate `React Navigation`?

> here you go [React Navigation Integration](./docs/react-navigation.md) :)
