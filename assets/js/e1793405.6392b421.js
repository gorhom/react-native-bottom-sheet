This allows for more customization and provides more stability overall.\\n\\n### Keyboard Handling\\n\\n<Video\\n  title=\\"React Native Bottom Sheet Keyboard Handling\\"\\n  url={useBaseUrl(\\"video/bottom-sheet-keyboard-handling-preview.mp4\\")}\\n/>\\n\\nKeyboard handling was released with `v3`, however, there were some issues that pushed this release. Now the keyboard handling is enabled by default and provides more options to customize the behavior, a new prop `android_keyboardInputMode` is introduced to handle the `Android` keyboard appearance config `windowSoftInputMode`.\\n\\nRead more about [Keyboard Handling](/keyboard-handling).\\n\\n### Pull to Refresh\\n\\n<Video\\n  title=\\"React Native Bottom Sheet Pull to Refresh\\"\\n  url={useBaseUrl(\\"video/bottom-sheet-pull-to-refresh-preview.mp4\\")}\\n/>\\n\\nOne of the earliest feature request that was submitted to repo [Pull to refresh](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-bottom-sheet/issues/66) by [gudberg](https://github.com/gudberg). There was an attempt to implement it on `v3` & `v2` but I was hit with their limitations, until now.\\n\\nThis feature is enabled by default, users need to provide `refreshing` & `onRefresh` to any of the [Scrollables](/scrollables) and voila!\\n\\nRead more about [Pull to Refresh](/pull-to-refresh).\\n\\n### Detach Sheet / Modal\\n\\n<Video\\n  title=\\"React Native Bottom Sheet Detach Modal\\"\\n  url={useBaseUrl(\\"video/bottom-sheet-detach-preview.mp4\\")}\\n/>\\n\\nAnother powerful addition to `BottomSheet` & `BottomSheetModal` is the ability to detach the sheet from the bottom - so no more bottom sheet \ud83d\ude05 -, which allows users to come up with lots of creative choices and customization to the sheet position.\\n\\nRead more about [Detach Sheet / Modal](/detach-modal).\\n\\n### Footer Component\\n\\n<Video\\n  title=\\"React Native Bottom Sheet Custom Footer\\"\\n  url={useBaseUrl(\\"video/bottom-sheet-footer-preview.mp4\\")}\\n/>\\n\\nLastly, I have added a new prop `footerComponent` to `BottomSheet` & `BottomSheetModal` to allow users to stick their custom component to the bottom of the sheet even when the keyboard is shown.\\n\\nRead more about [Footer Component](/custom-footer).\\n\\n## Breaking changes\\n\\n#### Removed\\n\\n- Removed `animationEasing` from `BottomSheet` props.\\n- Removed `animationDuration` from `BottomSheet` props.\\n- Removed `closeOnPress` from `BottomSheetBackdrop` props.\\n- Removed `dismissOnClose` from `BottomSheetModal` props.\\n- Removed `enableFlashScrollableIndicatorOnExpand` from `BottomSheet` props.\\n\\n#### Changes\\n\\n- `snapPoints` prop is no longer accepting `0` as a value.\\n- `animateOnMount` props default value is `true`\\n\\n## Changelog\\n\\nHere are the highlight change log of `v4`\\n\\n#### Refactored\\n\\n- create one generic scrollable component ([`#442`](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-bottom-sheet/pull/442)).\\n- converted all internal state/memoized variables to reanimated shared values.
